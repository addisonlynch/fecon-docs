Overview
========

**fecon235** and **fecon236** provide an interface for financial economics to the Python ecosystem, especially packages for mathematics, statistics, science, engineering, and data analysis. Complex packages such as numpy, pandas, statsmodels, scipy, and matplotlib are seamlessly integrated at a high-level with APIs of various data hosts for:

- Essential commands which correctly handle annoying low-level pitfalls.
- Retrieval of economic and financial data, both historical and the most current.
- Data munging, for example, resampling and alignment of time-series data from hosts using mutually incompatible formats.
- Analysis using techniques from econometrics, time-series analysis, and statistical machine learning.
- Abstraction and software optimization of mathematical operators, for example, linear algebra used in portfolio analysis.
- Visualization of data using graphical packages.
- Reproducible research which is collaborative and openly accessible at zero cost.
